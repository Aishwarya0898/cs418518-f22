General Information:

## Description

This class will introduce Web Programming: the process of writing interactive applications accessible through the WWW. We will develop in the LAMP environment: Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL, and Elasticsearch. In addition, we will introduce JavaScript, a popular client-side web programming language, the Model-View-Controller architecture, and security features such as ReCaptcha and the cross-site vulnerability (XSS) and clickjacking attack. Emphasis will be on the integration of these components for a useful application. Lectures will provide the overview of various concepts and the class will be centered around development of a semester-long project. Students have the freedom to build a web application from scratch or based on open-source frameworks.
Successful students will be proficient in LAMP stack development and modern web design. The course will give best practice instruction and guidance in developing a website whose primary goal is to help users find useful online resources using search engines. Students will be evaluated on progressive milestones based on the instructor’s specified features. The course will put weight on writing quality web programming codes and implementing different functions. Git will be used for version control.
